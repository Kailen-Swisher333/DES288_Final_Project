                <h2>Charlie Designs</h2>
            </a>
            <h3>He is currently doing a series where he designs and prints a different thing everyday and I find it to
                be really interesting to see how he problem solves and I like how he will show designs that end up not
                working great as well along side the ones that do. He also explores a lot of different things, ranging from
                tools to toys to random experiments, and I think that that the ability to branch out into different areas is really important.</h3>

                <h2>Ken from the frontoffice</h2>
            </a>
            <h3>I am not particularly interested in fashion design but the way that Ken presents his knowledge is super
                thoughtful and intentional. They do a lot of work in combining different cultures and traditions and he
                really does a deep dive into the history of it all. I really do think it's important to branch out into
                different fields enough to at least get a general understanding of it, and their presentation of their
                textile knowledge is invaluable.</h3>

                <h2>Scott from ScottDropAndRoll</h2>
            </a>
            <h3>He is a prop master who does work for tv and movies who also makes content about the process of making
                these
                props and I think he provides a really cool insight on the prop industry as well as offering a unique
                way of looking at materials, as half the time his job is to make a material look identical to a different
                material while acting completely differently. he also teaches a lot about how to treat or finish a material to
                make it look aged or worn or brand new, which might be an important skill to have as a product designer.</h3>
